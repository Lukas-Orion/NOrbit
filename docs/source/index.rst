Welcome to NOrbit's documentation!
==================================

NOrbit is an N-body Integrator that uses the Runge-Kutta 4th Order method to calculate the gravitational interactions of multiple objects and plots their orbit evolution through time.
Who is this for?

Who is it for?
--------------

Astronomers that need a visualization of multiple object interactions. It is also recommended to astronomy students that got into numerical methods, since N-body integrators are essential for many astronomical simulations.

Additionally, NOrbit is a god tool for checking the stability of a planetary system over a given amount of time.
